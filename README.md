## My process
I started by planning the site structure and designing reusable components for pages like About, Contact, and Products. Then I:

1. Set up a Next.js project with TypeScript.

2. Built reusable React components for sections, cards, buttons, and forms.

3. Integrated Firebase for authentication and data management.

4. Added AI chatbot functionality for user interaction.

5. Optimized images and video backgrounds for a polished visual experience.

6. Deployed the site to Vercel for production-ready hosting.
